# @acpaas-ui/ngx-navigation-menu

**NavigationMenu**

This component provides a generic navigation menu that can be used in your projects, providing an administrative-like interface look and feel. The navigation menu features two basic modes: (mode selection is done automatically and cannot be configured manually)

- **Mobile mode**: On mobile, the component will feature a navigation bar that places itself on the bottom of the screen. Navigation links will appear as tabs, making it possible to display a maximum of 3 tabs. If more navigation links are configured, a 'More' tab will automatically be created, embedded the invisible links under that tab. An animation highlights the navigation as the user scrolls though the different menus.

- **Desktop mode**: On desktop, the component features a navigation bar that places itself on the outright left border of the screen. The desktop mode integrates two layouts: docked and undocked. The default mode can be set through module configuration. When docked, the menu only displays square icons io full navigation links. Clicking on the link will trigger opening up sub menu items in overlay mode. When not docked, the menu features different accordeons, containing the configured navigation links.
